# TwinTurbine-DCDC
This is a group Academic Project for **DCDC** course at Stockholm University, designed to experience a **digital twin** project in immersive technology.
<!--![{Your App XR} logo](./docs/example-image.jpg)-->

<!--information/ **MarkDown** reference is available here: <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>_-->

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **_TwinTurbine_**, which is a **digital twin** project that lets you experience working with wind turbine in a mixed reality environment.

The proposed solution is valuable for remote monitoring and controlling, and improving turbine's performance.

## 2. Design Process

<!--Evidence on the general overview of how you planned, designed, and developed your project, including the goals, challenges, and solutions._]-->
The design process includes ideation of concepts and interactions, testing of technologies, creation of Unity scene, user testing, iteration, and demonstration. 

### 2.1. Brainstorming:
After some brainstorming, we came up with some ideas for different stages:

- In the first step, we discussed the physical and virtual entities, their connection, and the services and functions we wanted to implement.

- Then, we shared our ideas on how to rotate the servo motor from Arduino and which physical turbine is better to provide.

- Finally, we focused on the way we want to make the connection between ESP32 and Unity

### 2.2. User Persona:
The Project's target users are engineers and technicians working with wind energy systems and Educational Institutions where the simulator can be used for training. Moreover, the main target group is enterprises interested in immersive technology.

### 2.3. User Journey:
<!--A visualization of how your user interacts with your project, from the initial trigger to the final outcome, and what emotions they experience along the way.-->
In the experience, a Physical Wind turbine would be emulated using a servo motor. Real-time data , including RPM of the wind turbine (represented by the servo motor) and the current generated by the turbine, are collected from the physical entity and transferred to the virtual environment for monitoring and visualization.

### 2.4. Wireframes and Prototypes:
<!-- A collection of sketches, mockups, or prototypes that show the layout, structure, and functionality of your project, and how you tested and iterated on them.-->
To understand how to rotate the physical wind turbine, the team members tried various strategies and tools to see which was more appropriate for our project.
