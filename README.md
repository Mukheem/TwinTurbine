## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **_TwinTurbine_**, which is a **digital twin** project that lets you experience working with wind turbine in a mixed reality environment.

The proposed solution is valuable for remote monitoring and controlling, and improving turbine's performance.

## 2. Design Process

<!--Add evidence on the general overview of how you planned, designed, and developed your project, including the goals, challenges, and solutions._]-->
The design process includes ideation of concepts and interactions, testing of technologies, creation of Unity scene, user testing, iteration, and demonstration. 

### 2.1. Brainstorming:
After some brainstorming, we came up with some idea for different stages

- User Persona: A description of your target user, their needs, motivations, and pain points, and how your project addresses them.
- User Journey: A visualization of how your user interacts with your project, from the initial trigger to the final outcome, and what emotions they experience along the way.
- Wireframes and Prototypes: A collection of sketches, mockups, or prototypes that show the layout, structure, and functionality of your project, and how you tested and iterated on them.
